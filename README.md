# linked-list

This project contains a singly linked list, a common data structure. 

You will need Node.js installed globally to run these files.

Take a look at the "documentation" present in the main file (placeholder.js) for a list of features the link list has.

Ensure you are in the repository's directory, then enter the following in the command line to run the main file:

```
node [placeholder].js
```
